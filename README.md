# ChatApplication
React based Chat application working with the aid of Chat Engine without authentication.

To enable this application , create a parent folder named as per your wish and create 2 child folders frontend and backend.
Install express, vite-react, using the node package manger(NPM) before executing the code. Install request client in the VScode extensions to enable authentications.
Paste the following files in the backend folder (make sure you dont miss indents) :
        i)index.json
        ii)request.rest
        iii)package-lock.json and package.json files will be automatically created as you install express.js (if you dont have them ,
        make sure you download it properly again.
Paste the following files in the frontend folder, these files have to be pasted in the src folder which will be installed by default (make sure you dont miss indents) :
        i)App.css
        ii)App.jsx
        iii)AuthPage.jsx
        iv)Chatspage.jsx
        v)main.jsx

Create an account in the https://chatengine.io/ website , this enables you to have your own dedicated server and possess the records. (Its free for 30 days and requires payment subsequently). succeeding the creation of an account you will be given a default id and secret key, paste the secret key in the code wherver required.)

VOILA!! Its done if you have followed the steps properly.
(TIP: MAKE SURE YOU ENTER THE SPELLINGS OF THE FILES PRECISELY AND GIVE PROPER INDENTS, follow this rigorously to avoid HOURS of debugging!)
